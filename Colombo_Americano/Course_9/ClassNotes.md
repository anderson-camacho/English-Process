my solution:
I usually sleep 7 hours every night.

She doesn't go to bed late on weekdays.

We are watching TV in bed right now.

He always wakes up at 6:30.

I am drinking more coffee this week.

They aren't sleeping well these days.

My brother takes a nap every Sunday.

Right now, I am trying to sleep earlier.

She sometimes feels tired in the morning.

At the moment, we are working long hours, so we are sleeping less.

He normally goes to bed at 11:00, but tonight he is staying up late.

People usually need around 7 or 8 hours of sleep.

She usually drinks tea before bed, but today she is having hot milk.
