I’d like to try soap making because it’s creative and useful. I can make gifts for friends.

Stargazing is amazing because it’s relaxing, and I love learning about stars and planets.

I wouldn’t try ice swimming because it’s too cold for me. I think it’s dangerous.

None of us likes taking care of exotic pets because it’s expensive and complicated.

We like skating, but it’s dangerous for our age.

We enjoy birdwatching because it’s peaceful and we can spend time in nature.

We don’t practice meditating in nature, but Xiomara would like to try it. Sara only prays.
